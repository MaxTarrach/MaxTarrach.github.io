The most fundamental definition of a blog is a website with a dated collection of entries, presented in reverse chronological order and  published to the internet.
The advantages of blogging raech far beyond the practice of writing. The process of collecting information, compressing it into blogposts and creating knowledge artefacts is highly profitable for the personal learning process and knowledge sharing between the author and the reader. Besides the raw content of a blogpost the medium plays a major role how and by who it is red.

## Medium is not  the perfect solution for everyone

It is 2021 and there is no way around medium.com. Medium has around 100 million monthly readers, subscriptions and a payment model for creators. Sounds good? It is! But for me the trade-offs outweigh the advantages: 

* *Content > Creator* - It may happen one of your posts goes viral. You may be happy with the crowd your post reaches. But this crowd won't connect with anything else you ever wrote or publish in the 
future.
* *Content ownership* - Medium takes the rights to use your content as they wish. Medium wants to delete your posts? They delete your post.
* *Paywalls are gaining momentum* - The trust in online ads shrinks continuously. The business model of Facebook and big media companies will be obsolete in a few years.

The ethical issues with medium is connected with Mediums payment processing partner Stripe. Stripe only pays Medium content creators from certain countries. A workaround is to start a US company which
is accompanied with high costs and not worth the effort for most creators.

## Jekyll as a solution

*Jekyll does what you tell it to do â€” no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.*

.. is the philosophy of jerkyll stated in it`s [README file](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown "Github page of README file").

Released by Preston Werner in 2008 Jekyll is one of the biggest static site generators. Publishing from a Github repository on Github Pages creates no additional costs. Sites are fully customizable
and not relying on databases. The content supports loading content from YAML, JSON, CSV or Markdown files.
The content is arranged in Markdown files. This implicates it's under full control of the content creator when it comes to making changes, deleting or exporting blogposts.
The writing can be done in the VI editor and guess what? We like the comfort!
